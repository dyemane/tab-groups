# Chrome Web Store Listing

## Name
Project Tab Groups

## Short Description (132 chars max)
Save, restore, and switch tab groups per project. Free, open source, keyboard shortcuts, export/import. No account required.

## Detailed Description

Project Tab Groups saves your Chrome tab group configurations as named projects. Switch between projects with one click or a keyboard shortcut. Groups persist across browser restarts.

Working on 3 projects with 5-8 tabs each in color-coded groups? Save each set as a project. One click to switch between them. Your tabs, colors, and group titles are all restored exactly as you left them.

WHY THIS EXTENSION?

Built because every tab manager is either too simple (OneTab — flat lists, no groups), too complex (Workona — accounts, cloud, paid tiers), or unreliable (Tab Group Manager — duplicates, lag). Project Tab Groups fills the gap: project-based, fast, free, and open source.

CORE FEATURES

- Save current tab groups as a named project
- Restore a project with all tabs, group colors, titles, and collapsed state
- Switch between projects (closes current groups, opens target)
- Auto-save active project when you add, move, or close tabs
- Persist across browser restarts (Chrome loses group IDs on restart — this extension re-creates them)
- Search across all projects by tab title or URL with highlighted matches
- Diff view — see what changed since your last save before updating
- Drag-and-drop reorder projects in the popup
- Tab count badge on extension icon
