# Chrome Web Store — Copy/Paste Fields

## Description

```
Project Tab Groups saves your Chrome tab group configurations as named projects. Switch between projects with one click or a keyboard shortcut. Groups persist across browser restarts.

Working on 3 projects with 5-8 tabs each in color-coded groups? Save each set as a project. One click to switch between them. Your tabs, colors, and group titles are all restored exactly as you left them.

WHY THIS EXTENSION?

Built because every tab manager is either too simple (OneTab — flat lists, no groups), too complex (Workona — accounts, cloud, paid tiers), or unreliable (Tab Group Manager — duplicates, lag). Project Tab Groups fills the gap: project-based, fast, free, and open source.

CORE FEATURES

- Save current tab groups as a named project
- Restore a project with all tabs, group colors, titles, and collapsed state
- Switch between projects (closes current groups, opens target)
- Auto-save active project when you add, move, or close tabs
- Persist across browser restarts (Chrome loses group IDs on restart — this extension re-creates them)

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

- Alt+Shift+Right — switch to next project
- Alt+Shift+Left — switch to previous project
- Alt+Shift+S — save/update current project
- Customize at chrome://extensions/shortcuts

EXPORT & IMPORT

- Export all projects as a JSON file (backup, share, or migrate)
- Import from JSON with duplicate detection
- Versioned format for forward compatibility
